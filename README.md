# EdukaExploits

This is a collection of various exploits that have been discovered on the [Eduka](https://klase.eduka.lt/) platform.

I hope that making these exploits easily accessible will force the devs of Eduka to consider patching them and making safer systems in the future.

## About

There are 2 types of exploits that I have discovered on Eduka platform. In this repo both of them have separate folders created, with the usage, how-to's and requirements described in them.

Here is a short description about both of them:

### Internal API

This exploit uses the internal Eduka api which can be found at [this](https://klase.eduka.lt/api/) (`https://klase.eduka.lt/api/`) endpoint. This type of exploit requires authentication (meaning that you will have to login into an Eduka account or use another type of authentication). This internal api exposes a lot of information about the user account, and quizzes that are assigned to the account. This vulnerability can be taken advantage of from any code or app that can send basic http requests.

### "mauthor" iframe

This exploit uses the JS functions that are loaded client side on an Eduka iframe called "mauthor". Functions in this iframe are responsible for loading quiz questions, storing and scoring the answers and a lot more. A lot of these functions require reverse engineering, but with enough effort they can be figured out and called forcibly, resulting in unexpected behavior from Eduka platform. This vulnerability can be exploited simply by using dev console or by injecting malicious JS into page at runtime (see an example chrome extension that uses this vuln here: [EdukaScores](https://github.com/Adomas-Alimas/EdukaScores)).
