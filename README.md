# EdukaExploits

---

This is a collection of `python3` classes that take advantage of various `https://klase.eduka.lt/api/` api exploits. They are intended to be used by developers for  easy creation of various automated answer checking, correct answer guessing apps.

I also hope that as a result of making these exploits more accessible, the devs of Eduka will consider patching them and making safer systems in the future.

## About

It seems that the Eduka platform internal api that handles quiz answers, students answered questions, scoring and other internal functions is easily accessible. In fact all of the available classes in this repo just use requests lib to abstract and simplify info gathering from various api endpoints. The only requirements for accessing the internal api are:

- correct auth data
- specific api endpoint

## Classes

This repo provides the following exploit classes:

- [internal_scores](internal_scores) - used for accessing internal scoring api, which is used by Eduka platform to determine how many 'points' for each answer the student will get.

Each of them uses a different method to gather different (and sometimes similar) data. More in-depth description of each class can be found in respective file docstrings.
